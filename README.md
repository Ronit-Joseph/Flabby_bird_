# Flabby_bird_
A project to help me learn at least the basics of game-dev,networking-socket-programming,web-dev etc.. all in an iteratively improving project.

milestones to keep track of while developing the Flappy Bird clone with multiplayer functionality and web implementation:
    will tick off each one after completion.

Week 1-2: Familiarization and Single-Player Version
During these two weeks, I will focus on getting familiar with Pygame and grasping the basic concepts of game development. I will start by studying Pygame's documentation, exploring its features, and understanding how it can be used to create games. My primary goal will be to develop a single-player version of Flappy Bird using Pygame. This will involve implementing essential game elements such as bird movement, pipes, scoring, collision detection, and game over conditions.

Week 3-4: Multiplayer Functionality
In the following two weeks, I will dive into researching WebSocket communication and selecting a suitable Python library for achieving multiplayer functionality. Libraries like Flask-SocketIO or Django Channels seem promising options. My aim will be to establish a basic server-client architecture that allows multiple players to participate in the game simultaneously. I will focus on implementing synchronized gameplay, enabling players to see and interact with each other's birds.

Week 5-6: Web Implementation
In these two weeks, I will dedicate my time to learning web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I will choose a web framework like Flask or Django. With this knowledge, I will create a basic web page that will serve as the game interface. To enable running the game in a web browser, I will integrate my existing Python game code with the chosen web framework.

Week 7-8: WebSocket Integration
During this period, my focus will be on implementing WebSocket communication between the web client and the server. I will work on establishing real-time communication channels that will enable features like real-time scoring and displaying multiple players' birds. Ensuring smooth and seamless multiplayer interaction will be a priority.

Week 9-10: Refinement and Testing
These two weeks will be dedicated to thorough testing and debugging of the game. I will conduct comprehensive tests to identify and address any issues or bugs that may arise. Furthermore, I will refine the gameplay experience by improving graphics, user interface, and overall user experience. Testing with multiple players will be crucial to ensuring that the multiplayer functionality functions as intended.

Week 11-12: Deployment and Finalization
In the final two weeks of the project, my focus will shift towards deployment and finalization. I will select a suitable hosting provider such as Heroku or AWS, and deploy the web application to make it accessible to others. Additionally, I will make any necessary adjustments or optimizations required for the deployed version of the game. Conducting thorough testing on the live server will be essential to ensure that the game performs smoothly and without any issues.
