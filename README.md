# Flabby_bird_
A project to help me learn at least the basics of game-dev,networking-socket-programming,web-dev etc.. all in an iteratively improving project.

milestones to keep track of while developing the Flappy Bird clone with multiplayer functionality and web implementation:
    will tick off each one after completion.

Week 1-2: Familiarization and Single-Player Version
During these two weeks, I will focus on getting familiar with Pygame and grasping the basic concepts of game development. I will start by studying Pygame's documentation, exploring its features, and understanding how it can be used to create games. My primary goal will be to develop a single-player version of Flappy Bird using Pygame. This will involve implementing essential game elements such as bird movement, pipes, scoring, collision detection, and game over conditions.

Week 3-4: Multiplayer Functionality
In the following two weeks, I will dive into researching WebSocket communication and selecting a suitable Python library for achieving multiplayer functionality. Libraries like Flask-SocketIO or Django Channels seem promising options. My aim will be to establish a basic server-client architecture that allows multiple players to participate in the game simultaneously. I will focus on implementing synchronized gameplay, enabling players to see and interact with each other's birds.
